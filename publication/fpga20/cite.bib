abstract = {360° panoramic video provides an immersive Virtual Reality experience. However, rendering
360° videos consumes excessive energy on client devices. FPGA is an ideal offloading
target to improve the energy-efficiency. However, a naive implementation of the processing
algorithm would lead to an excessive memory footprint that offsets the energy benefit.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-designed system that dramatically
reduces the on-chip memory requirement of VR video processing to enable FPGA offloading.
Evaluation shows that our system is able to achieve significant energy reduction with
no loss of performance compared to today's off-the-shelf VR video rendering system.},
